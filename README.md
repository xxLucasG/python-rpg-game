# Console RPG Game

Welcome to your own RPG Game! In this text-based adventure, your goal is to escape the house and reach the Garden while avoiding monsters. To succeed, you must find a key and a potion.

## Instructions

Upon starting the game, you will find yourself in a hall. From there, you can navigate through different rooms and interact with items using simple commands.

### Commands

- `go [direction]`: Move to the specified direction (north, south, east, west).
- `get [item]`: Pick up an item from the current room.

## Gameplay

You start the game in the Hall. The layout of the house is as follows:

Your current inventory will be displayed along with your location. Be cautious, as encountering a monster without the necessary items will result in a game over.
